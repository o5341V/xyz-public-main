// We call this one the ECO for short, but it will be listed on the indicator list 
// at W. Blau’s Ergodic Candlestick Oscillator. The ECO is a momentum indicator. 
// It is based on candlestick bars, and takes into account the size and direction 
// of the candlestick "body". We have found it to be a very good momentum indicator, 
// and especially smooth, because it is unaffected by gaps in price, unlike many other 
// momentum indicators.
// We like to use this indicator as an additional trend confirmation tool, or as an 
// alternate trend definition tool, in place of a weekly indicator. The simplest way 
// of using the indicator is simply to define the trend based on which side of the "0" 
// line the indicator is located on. If the indicator is above "0", then the trend is up. 
// If the indicator is below "0" then the trend is down. You can add an additional 
// qualifier by noting the "slope" of the indicator, and the crossing points of the slow 
// and fast lines. Some like to use the slope alone to define trend direction. If the 
// lines are sloping upward, the trend is up. Alternately, if the lines are sloping 
// downward, the trend is down. In this view, the point where the lines "cross" is the 
// point where the trend changes.
// When the ECO is below the "0" line, the trend is down, and we are qualified only to 
// sell on new short signals from the Hi-Lo Activator. In other words, when the ECO is 
// above 0, we are not allowed to take short signals, and when the ECO is below 0, we 
// are not allowed to take long signals.
